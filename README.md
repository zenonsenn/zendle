Zendle is a finite word game where the only limit is the validation dictionary. The purpose of this game is to provide a stress-free version of Wordle; why stress over getting it in 6 when you can get it eventually?

The game starts with you, the player, submitting any valid English word of your desire (no single letter words). The last letter of that word will be the first letter of the next word for you to guess! Zendle allows you to stray away from what it wants you to do, but there would be penalties. However, you do not need to worry; anything goes as long as the word is valid!
